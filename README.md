Jmulate ![Build](https://api.travis-ci.org/PrashntS/jmulate.svg?branch=master)
==============================================================================
The work presented here is a proof-of-concept approach of benchmarking a browser’s virtualization abilities in native JavaScript engine implementation. Jmulate also uses some of the HTML5 exclusive features, such as Canvas, and “webkitMovement” event handler for its adapters. Most remarkable aspect of this project would be, however, the capability of Modern Web browsers that are able to run a full Linux system inside their sandboxed environment on client side.
